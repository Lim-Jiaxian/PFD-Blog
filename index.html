        <p>
            The first week of PFD lesson involves the objectives of undertaking real-life IT projects by making use of
            scrum (Lightweight Framework) via different challenge statements. My team was assigned the challenge
            statement
            of "Data Collection Applications". <br><br> After a brainstorming session, we
            arrived at a concept that involves utilizing both a mobile phone and a wristband to monitor the wearer's
            location. Additionally, we also plan to leverage the built-in Bluetooth functionality to communicate with
            other nearby devices. However, this idea concept is quite similar to an existing application called
            SGTRACETOGETHER. As a
            result, my team is looking forward to discuss with our lecturer to refine and solidify it.

        <p>
            After meeting with our lecturer, our team decided to discard our prior concept because it did not
            accurately correspond with the challenge statement. Subsequently, we have opted to redirect our efforts
            towards the development of a mobile Arduino
            pathway tracker that uses GPS. The device comprises an ESP32 MCU Module, which has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
            capabilities, as well as a GPS tracker to follow the user's movements. <br><br> Additionally, there will be
            an AWS
            API Gateway connection between the ESP32 and AWS DynamoDB, which will be used to store the location data
            gathered by the GPS. Finally, to plot the course that the user has travelled, the Python library Matplotlib
            will be utilized. While the current sprints are focused on research, this important work is essential to
            ensure that my team and I have a solid foundation for development. Once we have obtained the required
            materials, I will be able to transition to development sprints and start building our project.

        <p>
            Since the ESP32 module has a built-in Wi-Fi component, it can transmit the location tracks captured by the
            GPS to the AWS API Gateway. The AWS API Gateway then routes the data to AWS DynamoDB for storing all the
            captured locations. To monitor the security guard's patrol path, the staff can access the AWS DynamoDB via
            the AWS API Gateway. Upon obtaining the data, they can use the Matplotlib library to plot a pathway graph
            map on
            Python. Matplotlib is a Python library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating data
            visualizations.

        <p>
            Apart from that, after completing the IBM Enterprise Design Thinking course, I learned how to apply the five
            stages of the design thinking process to solve real-world problems: empathize, define, ideate, prototype,
            and test.
            I also learned how to collaborate with others and use feedback to iterate on my ideas.
            Design thinking is a powerful tool that can be used to create innovative solutions to a wide range of
            challenges.

        <img src="./img/Materials.jpg" class="center"><br>
        <p>
            Finally, after a week of waiting, I was finally able to get my hands on the ESP32 NodeMCU, a breadboard, and
            a
            couple of jumper wires. This mark the start and beginning of my journey to create the SEER GPS Tracker.
            Despite not having the GPS Tracker device yet, i have initiated the process of conducting and testing the
            evaluation of the ESP32 NodeMCU's functionality to ensure that it is in a proper working condition.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Arduino Board Manager - </p>
        <img src="./img/Arduino_BM.png" class="center">
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Blink Start Code - </p>
        <img src="./img/Blink_Start.png" class="center"><br>
        <p>
            To begin testing the functionality of the ESP32 NodeMCU development board, I utilized the Arduino IDE,
            an open-source integrated development environment that enables users to write, compile, and upload code to
            Arduino boards. Since the ESP32 NodeMCU board is compatible with the Arduino IDE, I decided to use this
            application to test its functionality.
            <br><br>
            Secondly, to ensure that my ESP32 NodeMCU board is properly supported by the Arduino IDE, I installed both
            the Arduino
            and Espressif Systems board packages for the ESP32. These packages contain all of the necessary files for
            the Arduino IDE to compile and upload code to ESP32 boards. This is important because different Arduino
            boards use different microcontrollers, and the Arduino IDE needs to know which microcontroller it is
            generating code for in order to produce the correct machine code.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, i made use of an online simple testing blink start.ino file for testing. Since the ESP32 NodeMCU
            has a built-in LED that can be controlled using the same digital pin as the Arduino board. To test the
            functionality of the ESP32 NodeMCU, i uploaded the blink start code to the ESP32 NodeMCU and observe the
            behavior of the built-in LED. If the LED blinks on and off every second, then the ESP32 NodeMCU is
            functioning properly.

        <h2>- Week 4 -</h2>
        <!--<img src="" height="250" width="600" class="center">

        <p>
            Moving onto week 4, although we were unable to obtain a GPS tracker, my team and I continued to work on
            finding solutions for plotting captured pathway locations on a map. We discovered a website guide: a GPS
            tracker that uses an SD card to record GPS locations, which can then be
            used to plot the coordinates on a map using a Python script with the Cartopy library. Since the website is
            relevant to our GPS location project, we decided to use the website as a fundamental foundation to guide,
            assist and enhance our SEER Project.
            <br><br>
            Website link: <a
                href="https://makersportal.com/blog/portable-gps-tracker-with-arduino">https://makersportal.com/blog/portable-gps-tracker-with-arduino</a>
            <br><br>
            At the current moment, my team and i are limited to only ESP32 NodeMCU and the python script guide (from
            makersportal) that is available to
            be worked and improved on. Hence, I decided to fill in randomly generated latitude & longtitude around Ngee
            Ann Polytechnic in a csv file to try and test if the python script is capable of plotting
            the Geo locations on a map.
            <br><br>
            To plot the pathway map, I used Jupyter Notebook to compile and execute the Python script. Initially, the
            execution failed because the Cartopy library was missing. (Cartopy is a Python library for geospatial data
            processing and visualization. It is built on top of the Matplotlib library and provides a variety of
            features with geospatial data and support map projections.) Thus, using the anaconda prompt, i installed the
            library via pip install cartopy.

        <p style="text-align: center;">- How the python script works - </p>
        <p>
            It works by parsing the GPS coordinates from a CSV file, and then formatting them for use with
            Cartopy. Next, it creates a Cartopy GeoAxes object and projects it using the coordinate reference system
            (CRS) of a street map. It then sets the extent of the map, adds the street map image, and plots the GPS
            points.
