        <p>
            The first week of PFD lesson involves the objectives of undertaking real-life IT projects by making use of
            scrum (Lightweight Framework) via different challenge statements. My team was assigned the challenge
            statement
            of "Data Collection Applications". <br><br> After a brainstorming session, we
            arrived at a concept that involves utilizing both a mobile phone and a wristband to monitor the wearer's
            location. Additionally, we also plan to leverage the built-in Bluetooth functionality to communicate with
            other nearby devices. However, this idea concept is quite similar to an existing application called
            SGTRACETOGETHER. As a
            result, my team is looking forward to discuss with our lecturer to refine and solidify it.

        <p>
            After meeting with our lecturer, our team decided to discard our prior concept because it did not
            accurately correspond with the challenge statement. Subsequently, we have opted to redirect our efforts
            towards the development of a mobile Arduino
            pathway tracker that uses GPS. The device comprises an ESP32 MCU Module, which has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
            capabilities, as well as a GPS tracker to follow the user's movements. <br><br> Additionally, there will be
            an AWS
            API Gateway connection between the ESP32 and AWS DynamoDB, which will be used to store the location data
            gathered by the GPS. Finally, to plot the course that the user has travelled, the Python library Matplotlib
            will be utilized. While the current sprints are focused on research, this important work is essential to
            ensure that my team and I have a solid foundation for development. Once we have obtained the required
            materials, I will be able to transition to development sprints and start building our project.

        <p>
            Since the ESP32 module has a built-in Wi-Fi component, it can transmit the location tracks captured by the
            GPS to the AWS API Gateway. The AWS API Gateway then routes the data to AWS DynamoDB for storing all the
            captured locations. To monitor the security guard's patrol path, the staff can access the AWS DynamoDB via
            the AWS API Gateway. Upon obtaining the data, they can use the Matplotlib library to plot a pathway graph
            map on
            Python. Matplotlib is a Python library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating data
            visualizations.

        <img src="./img/Materials.jpg" class="center"><br>
        <p>
            Finally, after a week of waiting, I was finally able to get my hands on the ESP32 NodeMCU, a breadboard, and
            a couple of jumper wires. This mark the start and beginning of my journey to create the SEER GPS Tracker.
            Despite not having the GPS Tracker device yet, i have initiated the process of conducting and testing the
            evaluation of the ESP32 NodeMCU's functionality to ensure that it is in a proper working condition.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Arduino Board Manager - </p>
        <img src="./img/Arduino_BM.png" class="center">
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Blink Start Code - </p>
        <img src="./img/Blink_Start.png" class="center"><br>
        <p>
            To begin testing the functionality of the ESP32 NodeMCU development board, I utilized the Arduino IDE,
            an open-source integrated development environment that enables users to write, compile, and upload code to
            Arduino boards. Since the ESP32 NodeMCU board is compatible with the Arduino IDE, I decided to use this
            application to test its functionality.
            <br><br>
            Secondly, to ensure that my ESP32 NodeMCU board is properly supported by the Arduino IDE, I installed both
            the Arduino
            and Espressif Systems board packages for the ESP32. These packages contain all of the necessary files for
            the Arduino IDE to compile and upload code to ESP32 boards. This is important because different Arduino
            boards use different microcontrollers, and the Arduino IDE needs to know which microcontroller it is
            generating code for in order to produce the correct machine code.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, i made use of an online simple testing blink start.ino file for testing. Since the ESP32 NodeMCU
            has a built-in LED that can be controlled using the same digital pin as the Arduino board. To test the
            functionality of the ESP32 NodeMCU, i uploaded the blink start code to the ESP32 NodeMCU and observe the
            behavior of the built-in LED. If the LED blinks on and off every second, then the ESP32 NodeMCU is
            functioning properly.

        <h2>- Week 4 -</h2>
        <p>
            Moving onto week 4, although we were unable to obtain a GPS tracker, my team and I continued to work on
            finding solutions for plotting captured pathway locations on a map. We discovered a website guide: a GPS
            tracker that uses an SD card to record GPS locations, which can then be
            used to plot the coordinates on a map using a Python script with the Cartopy library. Since the website is
            relevant to our GPS location project, we decided to use the website as a fundamental foundation to guide,
            assist and enhance our SEER Project.
            <br><br>
            Website link: <a
                href="https://makersportal.com/blog/portable-gps-tracker-with-arduino">https://makersportal.com/blog/portable-gps-tracker-with-arduino</a>
            <br><br>
            At the current moment, my team and i are limited to only ESP32 NodeMCU and the python script guide (from
            makersportal) that is available to
            be worked and improved on. Hence, I decided to fill in randomly generated latitude & longtitude around Ngee
            Ann Polytechnic in a csv file to try and test if the python script is capable of plotting
            the Geo locations on a map.
            <br><br>
            To plot the pathway map, I used Jupyter Notebook to compile and execute the Python script. Initially, the
            execution failed because the Cartopy library was missing. (Cartopy is a Python library for geospatial data
            processing and visualization. It is built on top of the Matplotlib library and provides a variety of
            features with geospatial data and support map projections.) Thus, using the anaconda prompt, i installed the
            library via pip install cartopy.

        <p style="text-align: center;">- How the python script works - </p>
        <p>
            It works by parsing the GPS coordinates from a CSV file, and then formatting them for use with
            Cartopy. Next, it creates a Cartopy GeoAxes object and projects it using the coordinate reference system
            (CRS) of a street map. It then sets the extent of the map, adds the street map image, and plots the GPS
            points.

        <p style="text-align: center;">- Day 1 - </p>
        <p>
            The first day of the hackathon, the long-awaited GPS Tracker finally arrived. I quickly got to work and connected it to my ESP32 NodeMCU to set the integration of the C++ code to bring the entire GPS Tracker system up. However, upon executing my first code sketch, the GPS Tracker failed to function as intended. 
            <br><br>
            The root cause of the malfunctioning GPS Tracker came from an error in referencing the wrong version of the ESP32 NodeMCU pin layout. Thus, leading to an incorrect pin configuration for the GPS Tracker. This mismatch between the expected and actual pin connections prevented the ESP32 NodeMCU from effectively establishing a connection and communicating with the GPS Tracker, rendering the entire system inoperable.
            <br><br>
            After some alterations, the output initially showed "unknown" location but displayed the correct date. However, rerunning the code caused a glitch, and the date reverted to 2001. Suspecting that there might be a CMOS battery issue, i researched more about the GPS device. The online research revealed that the Neo-M6 GPS HAT with Antenna for Raspberry Pi lacks a CMOS battery for date maintenance. It relies on the Raspberry Pi's power supply, losing date and time information when the Raspberry Pi is turned off.

        <p style="text-align: center;">- Day 2 - </p>
        <p>
            Onto day 2 of the hackathon, due to time constraints in getting the Raspberry Pi to work, our team focused on plotting a map using generated GPS coordinates of latitude and longitude. 
            <br><br>
            To visualize the pathway traversed using the captured GPS coordinates of longitude and latitude, a Python script is employed, leveraging the functionalities of both Matplotlib and Cartopy libraries. This combination of tools enables the creation of an informative and visually appealing map that effectively conveys the movement patterns captured by the GPS data. Thus, allowing an evaluation to monitor potential areas of improvement or certain blind spots / unpatrolled sections of the security guard's route.
            <br><br>
            What is Matplotlib? <br><br> Matplotlib serves as the core framework for generating the map, providing a versatile platform for constructing and customizing various plot elements. Its extensive repertoire of functions and capabilities allows for precise control over the map's appearance, including the selection of projection, scale, and styling of geographical features.
            <br><br>
            What is Cartopy? <br><br> Cartopy, on the other hand, brings specialized expertise in handling geospatial data, seamlessly integrating with Matplotlib to enhance the map's geographical accuracy and context. Its advanced features enable the incorporation of coastline data, country borders, and other relevant geographical information, transforming the map into a comprehensive representation of the real world.

        <p>
            Moving to the 3rd day of the hackathon, our team will present our GPS prototype, a solution designed to revolutionize security guard patrol monitoring in the security industry. Our innovative approach effectively addresses the challenge of recording security guard prowl paths, ensuring comprehensive coverage and mitigating potential security breaches.
            <br><br><br>
            Addressing the Challenge:
            <br><br>
            The security industry faces a persistent challenge: ensuring that security guards diligently follow their designated patrol routes, effectively safeguarding properties and personnel. Our prototype tackles this challenge head-on by providing a real-time, comprehensive solution for monitoring security guard patrols. Our system meticulously captures and records the security guard's every movement, providing a detailed record of their patrol path. This tracking capability enables immediate identification of any deviations from the established patrol route, allowing for timely intervention.
            <br><br>
            Innovation and Key Concepts:
            <br><br>
            Our prototype transcends conventional security solutions by incorporating groundbreaking features and adopting an innovative approach. At the core of our system lies a sophisticated GPS tracking technology that continuously monitors the security guard's movements, providing precise information about their patrol route. This real-time tracking capability goes beyond mere location monitoring; it captures the guard's pace, direction, and any pauses or deviations, creating a comprehensive picture of their patrol activities.
            <br><br>
            Complementing the GPS tracking system is a powerful data analytics platform that transforms raw patrol data into actionable insights. Our platform analyzes patrol patterns, identifying areas of frequent coverage, potential gaps in security, and any unusual deviations from established routes. These insights empower security managers to optimize patrol routes, ensuring that every area receives the necessary attention.

            Firstly, the ESP32 NodeMCU with its built-in WiFi capabilities can effectively communicate with web servers and send data. In this scenario, the ESP32 will be used to collect the GPS coordinates, which will then be transmitted to a MySQL database via an HTTP POST request to the PHP Webpage. PHP, a scripting language, will handle the server-side processing of receiving the data from the ESP32, and storing it in the MySQL database. Next, a python script with multiple libraries such as matplotlib and cartopy will be used to plot out the entire route and pathway of the security guard to visualise for areas of improvements.
