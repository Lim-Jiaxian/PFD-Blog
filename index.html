            The first week of PFD lesson involves the objectives of undertaking real-life IT projects by making use of
            scrum (Lightweight Framework) via different challenge statements. My team was assigned the challenge
            statement
            of "Data Collection Applications." After a brainstorming session, we
            arrived at a concept that involves utilizing both a mobile phone and a wristband to monitor the wearer's
            location. Additionally, we also plan to leverage the built-in Bluetooth functionality to communicate with
            other nearby devices. However, this idea concept is quite similar to an existing application called
            SGTRACETOGETHER. As a
            result, my team is looking forward to discuss with our lecturer to refine and solidify it.

        <p>
            After meeting with our lecturer, our team decided to discard our prior concept because it did not
            accurately correspond with the challenge statement. Subsequently, we have opted to redirect our efforts
            towards the development of a mobile Arduino
            pathway tracker that uses GPS. The device comprises an ESP32 MCU Module, which has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
            capabilities, as well as a GPS tracker to follow the user's movements. Additionally, there will be an AWS
            API Gateway connection between the ESP32 and AWS DynamoDB, which will be used to store the location data
            gathered by the GPS. Finally, to plot the course that the user has travelled, the Python library Matplotlib
            will be utilized. While the current sprints are focused on research, this important work is essential to
            ensure that my team and I have a solid foundation for development. Once we have obtained the required
            materials, I will be able to transition to development sprints and start building our project.

            - How the product works - <br><br>
            Since the ESP32 module has a built-in Wi-Fi component, it can transmit the location tracks captured by the
            GPS to the AWS API Gateway. The AWS API Gateway then routes the data to AWS DynamoDB for storing all the
            captured locations. To monitor the security guard's patrol path, the staff can access the AWS DynamoDB via
            the AWS API Gateway. Upon obtaining the data, they can use the Matplotlib library to plot a pathway graph
            map on
            Python. Matplotlib is a Python library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating data
            visualizations.

        <p>- IBM Enterprise Design Thinking -</p>
        <p>
            Apart from that, after completing the IBM Enterprise Design Thinking course, I learned how to apply the five
            stages of the design thinking process to solve real-world problems: empathize, define, ideate, prototype,
            and test.
            I also learned how to collaborate with others and use feedback to iterate on my ideas.
            Design thinking is a powerful tool that can be used to create innovative solutions to a wide range of
            challenges.

            <li>
                <b>Engage in Empathetic Understanding:</b> I learned the art of empathizing with end-users, delving deep
                into
                their
                experiences, needs, and emotions, allowing the benefit to better comprehend their perspectives and pain
                points.

            <li>
                <b>Precisely Define Problem Statements:</b> A crucial skill & ability to precisely define problem
                statements, ensuring that the challenges at hand are thoroughly understood and accurately framed.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Cultivate Creative Ideation:</b> The course encouraged creative ideation techniques and the
                importance of
                generating a
                plethora of innovative ideas & concepts to tackle the defined problems.

            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Master Rapid Prototyping:</b> Being proficient in creating quick, user-focused, and iterative
                prototypes to validate and refine ideas and concepts efficiently. It is a vital skill for design
                thinkers as it helps them move from abstract concepts to tangible, testable representations of their
                solutions, ultimately leading to more effective and user-centric designs.
